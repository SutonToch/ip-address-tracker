# Frontend Mentor - IP address tracker solution

This is a solution to the [IP address tracker challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0).
This project does not have a Live-Site because I made a mistake and the request limit of the one-time trial from ipifiy is used up, so there wouldn't be a point.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- fetching data from API
- How to use ReactLeafletJS

### Useful resources

- [iHateRegex](https://ihateregex.io/expr/ip/) - Even though I don't hate regex, not having to do the regex for IPv4 or IPv6 was very useful.
